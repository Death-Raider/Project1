could revolutionize the medical field if more effort is applied. I have a strong desire and discipline for my goals and dreams expressed
through my various projects on Artificial Intelligence and the self-study needed for it. My interests in the medical field lay with
Immunology and Psychology; I would love an opportunity to build upon them further.`,

between my professional and personal interests which reduced burnout and increased my productivity.`,
        Para2: `My accomplishments are few, but they carry deeply personal meaning to me. I have made a Machine Learning Package on NPM from scratch, and it
was the project that allowed me to apply and test AI theory firsthand, boosting my confidence. I learned a lot from this experience. Building on that, I have
also made a Rainfall Prediction AI which allows me to take the entire world rainfall data of the Earth and make future predictions on the rainfall pattern with
an accuracy of 90%. Another currently ongoing project is Computer Vision, which uses three different convolutional AI models attempting to mimic the human
players in the game Minecraft. Among the various projects, these were my top three projects which make me proud.` ,
